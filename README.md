# Vesta React Exercise

Your job is to display cards for ![this data](src/data.json) in the app. A screenshot is below to use as a guide, but we're not looking for a perfect match. There should also be at least one passing test.

You should be able to complete this in under an hour. Please don't spend more time unless you **really, really** want to. When you're done, create a branch and make a pull request into main.
